# Ingredient Finder

## Tech Stack:
Backend: Rails\
Frontend: React\
Recipe Data: Custom Python Script for web scraping\

## Description
I built an app to solve the “what do I do with these carrots before they go bad” dilemma. You type in an ingredient you have, and it searches a recipe database for ideas. 

## Future Enhancements
- Allow users to input multiple ingredients 
- Add user accounts to save favorite recipes or mark as “tried”
- Updated UI styling
- Increase Recipe DB size
